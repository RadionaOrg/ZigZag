Put battery and you will see one LED slightly ON.

There is 5 second programming delay, please wait 5 seconds and badge will start doing LED RAIDER.

### Badge sleep

Hold button until you see all leds on, release button and badge will go to sleep.

In sleep mode badge will consume around 1mA.

To go out of sleep just press button again.

If you will not use badge for long period it is best to remove battery.

### Modes

This badge has 10 cases, 5 are morse code 5 are Pov ( Persistance of Vision ).

On button press you are moving to next case.

### Morse 

It is hardly human readable, so you will need to use some app, or write your own...

Each LED has it's own message, first 4 are encoded clues or keys for last one.

Fourth message is not the same for public and spaekers so make sure you have both.

Last message is encrypted.

Who gets all 5 messages gets the prize!!!
